## Projects
### Internship Management System
The Internship Management System allows employees to add, edit, and delete available internships, view student applications, and respond to reviews. Students can browse available internships, apply for the ones that interest them, check the status of their applications, and leave reviews. Once a student applies for an internship, they receive a confirmation email. Additionally, students are notified by email when an employer responds to their application. Admins have full access to monitor all activities within the system, including viewing student applications, submitted reviews, and available internships.
